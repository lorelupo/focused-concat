# Focused Concatenation for Context-Aware Neural Machine Translation

This repository will soon contain the official implementation of the main experiments discussed in the WMT22 paper [Focused Concatenation for Context-Aware Neural Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13388). The implementation is based on the [fairseq package v0.9.0](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/v0.9.0).
